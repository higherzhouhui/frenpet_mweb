  incentivized pool during the early stages of the project. It encourages
  contributors to generate more trade taxes, thereby unlocking additional rewards
  on the leaderboard. (Example of incentive rules: When the daily trading volume
  exceeds 500K, the mining reward multiplier for transaction fees in the range of
  500K-1M is released into the leaderboard with a multiplier of 1.1-1.2x; when the
  daily trading volume exceeds 1M, the mining reward multiplier for the range of
  1M-2M is 1.2-1.3x; when the daily trading volume exceeds 2M, the mining reward
  multiplier for the range of 2M-3M is 1.3-1.5x; when the daily trading volume
  exceeds 5M, the mining reward multiplier for the range of 5M-10M is 1.5-1.7x;
  when the daily trading volume exceeds 10M, the mining reward multiplier for the

  assist in order to receive food or items. If the assisted friend successfully
  joins and mints a pet, the player can claim $10 worth of $FFP after 72 hours of
  the friend's pet feeding. Additionally, by assisting through the referral link
  for pet minting, the player will also receive the refund funds from the next
